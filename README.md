# EFCoreCommerceDemo

Small demo showing how to use DDD with Persistence Ignorance using Entity Framework Core 3.

For a detailed explanation check the series on my blog: https://www.davideguida.com/lets-do-some-ddd-with-entity-framework-core-3/ .

- Example 1 shows a basic modeling of products, quotes and orders. Everything is enclosed in a small Console application.
- Example 2 has some improvements (eg. adding a proper "Money" class) and uses WebAPI.
